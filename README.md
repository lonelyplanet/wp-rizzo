# WP Rizzo

This plugin provides html content from [Rizzo](http://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/).
It will automatically include the head section, body header, and footer section.

It hooks into the `wp_head` and `wp_footer` functions to output the HTML content.

Since WordPress doesn't have a function like `wp_footer` for the body, I had to use
output buffering to automatically insert the body header into the html.

## Features

I've created a settings page where you can change the following:

* API endpoint URLs
* API connection timeout limit (seconds)
* WP cron interval (seconds)
* Which content to auto insert into the HTML.

Contact us if you need custom endpoints.

### Output Buffering

If you donâ€™t want to use output buffering, uncheck "Insert Pre Header Content" and "Insert Post Header Content", and place this in your theme after the &lt;body&gt; tag:

```php
<?php
if ( function_exists( '\LonelyPlanet\Rizzo\print_headers' ) ) {
    \LonelyPlanet\Rizzo\print_headers();
}
?> 
```
